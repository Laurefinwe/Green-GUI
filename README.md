# Green-GUI
GUI for SDL 1.2, written in C99

Goal of this project, is to make small and fast GUI for SDL, using structural programming language. 
Feel free to make patches and suggest features that I can implement.
If you have only ANSI C implementation on your computer, you have to implement bool type by yourself.
